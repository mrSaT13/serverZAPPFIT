# Contributing to Endurain
 
Thank you for considering contributing to Endurain! Before diving in, please read these guidelines carefully. They exist to make the process sustainable for everyone.

## A Note on Maintainership
 
Endurain is maintained by a single person in their spare time. This means review bandwidth is genuinely limited. Following these guidelines isn't bureaucracy, it's what allows contributions to actually get merged rather than sitting in a queue indefinitely.

## Before You Write Any Code
 
**Open an issue first.** For anything beyond a small bug fix, typo, or documentation improvement, please open an issue and wait for a response before writing code. This takes minutes and can save you hours of work on something that won't be merged because it conflicts with planned direction, existing work, or project scope.
 
If an issue already exists, comment on it to signal your intent so work isn't duplicated.

## Pull Request Size — The Most Important Rule
 
**Keep PRs small and focused on a single concern.**
 
As a rule of thumb:
 
- **Target under 300 lines changed** (excluding lock files, generated code, and migrations)
- **One PR = one thing.** Don't bundle a bug fix with a refactor with a new feature
- If your change is naturally large (e.g. a new integration), break it into a chain of smaller PRs that can each be reviewed and merged independently

PRs that are too large to review efficiently will be asked to be split before they receive a review. This isn't a judgment on the quality of the work, it's a maintainability constraint.
 
**Excluded from the line count:** `package-lock.json`, `uv.lock`, migration files, and other generated or vendored files.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**
- **uv** (installed globally) — see [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **Hatch** is included as a dev dependency — run `cd backend && uv sync` once to install it

## How to Contribute
 
### Bug Fixes

- Check if an issue already exists before opening a new one
- Include clear steps to reproduce in the issue
- Small, targeted fixes are the fastest path to a merge

### Documentation

- Always welcome and rarely requires prior discussion
- Improvements to the docs site, inline code comments, and the README all count
- Keep the same tone and structure as existing docs

### Translations

- Endurain uses [Codeberg Translate](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/endurain/) for i18n
- Please contribute translations there rather than via PRs to the repo

### New Features

- **Always discuss in an issue first** — this is required, not optional
- Features that haven't been discussed and approved in an issue may be closed without review, regardless of quality
- Check the [ROADMAP.md](https://codeberg.org/endurain-project/endurain/src/branch/master/ROADMAP.md) before proposing something that may already be planned

### Refactors and Code Quality

- Must be discussed in an issue first
- Pure refactor PRs (no behaviour change) are easiest to review. Keep them separate from feature or fix PRs
- Include a clear explanation of what improved and why


## Getting Started
 
1. **Fork the repository** on Codeberg
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://codeberg.org/YOUR_USERNAME/endurain.git
   ```
3. **Create a branch** and use a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/garmin-sync-timeout
   # or
   git checkout -b feat/gpx-export
   ```
4. **Make your changes**, committing with clear messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

   **Format:** `<type>(<scope>)!: <description>` - `(<scope>)` and the breaking-change `!` are optional.

   The following rules are enforced automatically on every PR (against the PR title and every commit subject) by the *Conventional Commits* workflow in `.forgejo/workflows/conventional-commits.yml`:

   - **Allowed types:** `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`.
   - **Description** must start with a lowercase letter and must not end with a period.
   - **Header length** (the first line) must be 72 characters or fewer.
   - **Scope** (optional) must be lowercase and may contain letters, digits, `-`, `_`, `.`, `/`, `,` or spaces — e.g. `feat(api): ...`, `fix(garmin): ...`.
   - **Breaking changes** are marked with `!` after the type/scope (e.g. `feat(api)!: ...`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit body.

   Examples:
   - `feat(api): add GPX export endpoint`
   - `fix(garmin): handle timeout on sync`
   - `refactor(activities)!: rename Activity.distance to total_distance`

5. **Validate changes before pushing:**
   - **Backend:** `cd backend && uv run hatch run validate` (or any individual script from `[tool.hatch.envs.default.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml`)
   - **Frontend:** `cd frontend && npm run format:check && npm run lint:check && npm run type-check`

   `uv run hatch run validate` runs lint, format, test, and typecheck sequentially in one command, which `uv run` alone does not yet offer. See `pyproject.toml` for the full list of available scripts.

   CI will enforce these checks on all PRs.

6. **Push and open a PR** against the `master` branch, filling in the PR template completely. The PR title must also follow the rules above — the *Conventional Commits* workflow validates it on every edit.

## Response Time Expectations
 
Reviews may take days to weeks depending on availability. A PR sitting without a response is not a rejection. Please feel free to leave a polite ping after two weeks if there's been no activity.

## Thank You
 
Even small contributions make a real difference. Thank you for taking the time to improve Endurain for everyone who self-hosts it.
