 * The reference upload pattern — security-sensitive:
 *
 * - Pre-validates with {@link assertValidActivityFile} (fail-fast UX; the
 *   backend is the real validator).
 * - Sends `multipart/form-data` via {@link FormData}. {@link apiFetch} leaves
 *   `Content-Type` unset for a `FormData` body so the browser adds the
 *   multipart boundary, and attaches the bearer token + CSRF header.
 * - The original filename travels only as the multipart part name. The server
 *   generates the stored filename (`save_validated_upload`), so the client
 *   filename is never used to build a URL, storage key, or path.
 * - Disables the default request timeout (`timeoutMs: 0`): a legitimate large
 *   upload can exceed the 30s API default, so cancellation is delegated to the
 *   caller-supplied {@link AbortSignal} instead.
 *
 * @param file - The activity file to upload.
 * @param options - Optional abort signal for cancellation (e.g. on unmount).
 * @returns The list of activities created from the file.
 * @throws {UploadValidationError} When client-side validation fails (no request
 *   is sent).
 * @throws {HttpError} When the server rejects or fails the upload.
