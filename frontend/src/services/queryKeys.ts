/**
 * Centralised TanStack Query key factories — the single source of truth for
 * every server-state cache key in the app.
 *
 * Why this exists: query keys are how TanStack Query identifies, caches, and
 * invalidates server data. When keys are hand-written as ad-hoc string arrays
 * (`['notifications']`) scattered across composables and realtime handlers,
 * they silently drift — a typo or a shape change in one place stops matching
 * the other, and invalidations quietly stop working. Routing every key through
 * this factory keeps reads, writes, and invalidations referring to the exact
 * same key.
 *
 * The canonical server-state pattern every feature should follow:
 *   1. service fn   — `apiFetch` + a mapper, in `@/services/<domain>.ts`
 *      (DTO → clean model boundary, e.g. {@link mapUserProfile}).
 *   2. key factory  — a domain entry in {@link queryKeys} below.
 *   3. composable    — `useXxxQuery()` in `@/composables/` calling `useQuery`
 *      with `queryFn` (the service fn) and `queryKey` (the factory).
 *   4. view          — consumes the composable; never calls `fetch`/`apiFetch`
 *      directly and never holds server data in Pinia.
 *
 * For writes, follow the mutation reference in `@/composables/useNotifications`
 * (`useMarkNotificationReadMutation`): optimistic `onMutate` + snapshot,
 * `onError` rollback, and `onSettled` invalidation of the domain's `all()` key.
 *
 * Adding a domain: follow the `notifications` shape — `all()` is the broad
 * prefix used for "invalidate everything in this domain"; `list(filters)` and
 * `detail(id)` narrow from it so partial invalidation (`all()`) cascades to
 * every list and detail query for that domain.
