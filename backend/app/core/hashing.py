"""Dependency-free hashing primitives shared across layers.

Holds the lowest-level hash helpers that both ``core`` infrastructure
(e.g. Redis key derivation) and higher layers (e.g. auth token hashing)
need. Keeping the primitive here — with no imports from ``core`` or
``auth`` — lets every layer depend on it downward without risking an
import cycle.
