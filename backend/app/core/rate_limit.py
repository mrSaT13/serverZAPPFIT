"""
Centralized rate limiting for the Endurain API.

Provides a single :data:`limiter` instance used by every
router, named tier constants for different endpoint
classes, and a JSON-aware 429 error handler.

The limiter key function hashes the Bearer token when
present (each session gets its own bucket) and falls
back to the proxy-aware client IP for unauthenticated
callers.

Architecture
------------
1. ``SlowAPIMiddleware`` applies :data:`DEFAULT` limits
   to every route automatically (no endpoint code
   changes needed).
2. Routers import a tier constant (e.g. :data:`WRITE`)
   and decorate individual endpoints with
   ``@limiter.limit(...)`` for tighter caps.
3. To add a new tier, define a module-level constant
   and document it in this module.
