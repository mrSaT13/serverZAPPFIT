    Function adds metadata to a parsed activity file that is about to be imported via the parse_and_store_activity_from_file() import routine.

    The function's primary purpose (i.e., why it was created) is to add metadata from a Strava activities.csv file to a parsed activity file from a Strava bulk import activity that is about to be imported.

    But this function also adds the import_info dictionary metadata to all generic bulk import activities, so it is called in all cases during a bulk import.

    The activity_metadata_dict is originally formed by the build_metadata_dict function, so see that function for contents / keys / etc.

    The function presumes that anything stored in the activities.csv file takes preference over contents of the parsed activity file.  This could be changed in the future (possibly a target for a user-selected option?)
        This decision was made becuase Joao's sample .fit files still contain a very generic title in the .fit files, but had a much more detailed name in Strava.
        # Code to give preference to items in the parsed activity file, should we ever want such a thing:

    Note that basic bulk imports will not have many of these field names in activity_metadata_dict, so ensure that they are checked for existence before value checking.
