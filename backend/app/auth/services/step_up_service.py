    Enforce step-up verification for sensitive account operations.

    A valid access token alone is not sufficient authorisation for
    operations that grant persistent account access (password
    change, API-key creation, MFA enrolment, MFA backup-code
    regeneration, MFA disable, etc.). This function requires the
    caller to re-prove possession of the current password and —
    when MFA is enabled — a fresh TOTP or backup code.

    SSO-only accounts have no local password (no row in
    ``users_local_credentials``). For those callers the password
    factor is skipped because there is nothing to verify against. The
    correct fix is to require a fresh IdP re-authentication for
    SSO-only accounts; this is not yet implemented.
    TODO(issue): create and link a tracker issue for fresh IdP
    re-auth on SSO-only step-up. Documented in
    ``docs/developer-guide/auth-boundary.md``.

    Failed verifications are tracked per-user with progressive
    lockout: 5 failures → 5 min, 10 → 30 min, 15 → 2 hours.
    Lockout is checked before any password or MFA comparison so
    that incorrect-guess enumeration is bounded even when the
    attacker has a valid access token.

    Args:
        user_id: ID of the authenticated user.
        current_password: The user's current password as supplied
            in the request body. May be ``None`` for SSO-only
            accounts.
        mfa_code: TOTP or backup code, required when MFA is
            enabled. Ignored when MFA is disabled.
        identity_service: Identity service dependency.
        step_up_store: Step-up lockout store.
        db: SQLAlchemy database session.

    Returns:
        None.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 429 if the user is currently locked out;
            401 if the current password is wrong, is missing for
            an account that has one, or when MFA is enabled and
            the supplied code is missing or invalid.
