"""Auth-owned maintenance tasks for scheduler integration.

This module is the single coherent surface the background scheduler uses to
run recurring auth cleanup jobs. Routing every scheduled auth cleanup through
here keeps ``core.scheduler`` from importing a scatter of low-level auth
``*.utils`` modules directly and gives auth one place to own its maintenance
contract.

Each name below is the exact callable scheduled by ``core.scheduler``; they
are re-exported unchanged so their sync/async nature and arguments are
preserved.
