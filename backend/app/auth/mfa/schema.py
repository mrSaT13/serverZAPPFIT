    Request model for MFA disable verification.

    Disabling MFA is a sensitive, security-reducing operation
    and must be gated by step-up verification: the caller has to
    re-prove possession of the current password in addition to a
    valid MFA code. The password length bounds match the other
    step-up schemas (see ``UsersEditPassword``) — they validate
    the supplied input only and do not impose a policy on the
    stored password.

    For SSO-only accounts (no local password set), the password
    field may be omitted and the password check is skipped — see
    :func:`auth.services.step_up_service.verify_step_up_credentials`
    and ``docs/developer-guide/auth-boundary.md`` for the rationale
    and the tracked SSO-only step-up gap.

    Request model for MFA setup verification.

    Enabling MFA binds a TOTP secret — just handed to the caller
    by ``POST /profile/mfa/setup`` — to the account, and issues
    backup codes. A stolen access token alone must not be enough
    to complete this binding (otherwise the attacker enrols their
    own authenticator and locks the legitimate user out), so the
    request is gated by step-up verification: the caller must
    re-prove their current password in addition to the freshly
    enrolled TOTP code.
